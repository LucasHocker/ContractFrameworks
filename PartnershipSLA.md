# Partnership Service Level Agreement (SLA)
This Partnership SLA creates incentives and disincentives to help align priorities between service provider ______________, henceforth **Provider**, and customer ________________, henceforth **Customer**. It provides a mechanism to regulary discuss, document, and agree on **Relationship Goals** and whether those were met without the need for contractual changes.  It also helps to discourage negative behaviors caused by misaligned priorities and incentives.

## Relationship Manager
Each party shall designate a **Relationship Manager** (RelMgr) and notify the other party in writing if the RelMgr is redesignated to another person. Both RelMgrs will meet quarterly to set **Relationship Goals** for the quarter and to review **Attainment** of the prior quarter's goals.

## Relationship Goals (Goals)
Each calendar quarter the RelMgrs will mutually agree and document four (4) Goals.  These are not contractual obligations and shall have no force of law under this or any other contract. RelMgrs should ensure that the Goals are specific, measurable, and attainable. For illustrative purposes, examples could include:
- Add _____________ functionality to product ____________
- Improve performance of ________________ by ___%
- Implement a process for _______________
- Achieve adoption rate of _______ for ________

## Revenue At Risk (RAR)
Each contract year, _______________ amount of annual revenue shall be at risk for SLA credits.  Quarterly, 1/4 of the annual RAR will be at risk.

## Bonus Targets (Bonus)
Each quarter, RelMgrs will mutually agree to and document a **Bonus Target**.  Said Bonus shall have no cash value, but should be mutually beneficial. Bonus is not a contractual obligation or right and shall have no force of law under this or any other contract.  RelMgrs must choose Bonus Targets that are compliant with both parties policies and procedures.  For illustrative purposes, examples could include:
- A public blog post concerning a mutually agreed topic
- ___ number of private customer references
- Speaking at public or private event on a mutually agreed topic

## Attainment
RelMgrs will mutually agree quarterly on whether the prior months Goals were successfully met.  If the number of successfully met goals was:
- 4 - The **Bonus Target** was earned
- 3 - Neutral, no Bonus or Credit
- 2 - Neutral, no Bonus or Credit
- 1 - 50% of quarterly RAR lost
- 0 - 100% of quarterly RAR lost

## Service Credits
Annually, Provider shall issue a **Service Credit** (Credit) in the amount of the sum total of the quarterly RAR lost.  For illustrative purposes, if the Attainment was as follows:
- Q1: 4 Goals met
- Q2: 3 Goals met
- Q3: 1 Goal met
- Q4: 0 Goals met
Then the Credit would be calculated as follows: annual RAR divided by 4 multiplied by 150%.

## Dispute Resolution
In the event RelMgrs cannot mutually agree on one or more of the following:
- setting the Goals for the coming quarter 
- whether the Goals from the prior quarter were successfully met
- whether or not an earned Bonus has been provided
then, the following process shall be followed:
1. Both RelMgrs shall document in writing their position and reasoning
2. If after the RelMgrs have met and discussed at least three (3) times but have not mutually agreed, the dispute shall be escalated to an executive from both parties
3. If after the executives have met and discussed at least twice (2 times), the Partnership SLA shall be suspended until such a time as both parties reach a mutual agreement or until the end of this contract
